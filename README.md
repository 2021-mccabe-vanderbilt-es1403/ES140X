Dr. Clare M<sup>c</sup>Cabe  
Email: c.mccabe@vanderbilt.edu   


**TA**<br/> 
Cal Craven  
Email: nicholas.c.craven@vanderbilt.edu

**Office Hours** <br/>

<br />
<br /> 

## [Before coming to the first class](instructions/create_github_account.md)

Students should create a GitHub account (if you do not have one already) and then email your GitHub username to Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Cabe and the TA (Cal Craven). You can receive the detail instruction be following the link in this header. 
<br/>


## Set up your computers (Before the second class)
Complete these instructions after your first class and before your second class (11/01-11/03). <br/>
[Mac Users](instructions/set_up_your_computers_MacOS.md) <br/>
[Windows and Linux Users](instructions/set_up_your_computers_Windows.md) <br/>

**Be aware that this can take some time, so start earlier to catch bugs and get help from your TA** <br/>

To participate in this class effectively, students will also need to create set up an Anaconda environment in their computer.
The Anaconda environment will help manage all the softwares used in this course.
The detailed instructions for those can be found by following the link for what type of computer you will be using.

## Install Etomica
Complete these instructions after your first class and before your second class (11/01-11/03). <br/>
[Mac Users](instructions/install_etomica_MacOS.md) <br/>
[Windows and Linux Users](instructions/install_etomica_Windows.md) <br/>

We will run some simulations using a learning module called etomica developed from the University of Buffalo. Here is a link to the website if you're curious about what it can do http://www.etomica.org/app/modules/

## Install VMD
Complete these instructions after your first class and before your second class (11/01-11/03). <br/>
[Mac Users](instructions/install_VMD_MacOS.md) <br/>
[Windows and Linux Users](instructions/install_VMD_Windows.md) <br/>

VMD is a molecular visualization software. We can use it to look at simulation data as a video editing software. We're going to use this to visualize some of the complex behavior found in polymers. More information can be found at https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/
