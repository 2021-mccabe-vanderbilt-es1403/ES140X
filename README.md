## [Before coming to the first class](instructions/create_github_account.md)

Students should create a GitHub account (if you do not have one already) and then email your GitHub username to Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Cabe and the TA (Cal Craven). Instruction on how to set up your github accout can be found by following the link in this header (click on Before coming to the first class). 
<br/>


## Set up your computers (Before the second class)
Complete these instructions after your first class and before your second class (11/01-11/03). <br/>
[Mac Users](instructions/set_up_your_computers_MacOS.md) <br/>
[Windows and Linux Users](instructions/set_up_your_computers_Windows.md) <br/>

**Be aware that this can take some time, so start earlier to catch bugs and get help from your TA** <br/>

To participate in this class effectively, students will also need to set up an Anaconda environment on their computer.
The Anaconda environment will help manage all the software packages used in this course.
Detailed instructions can be found by following the links above for the type of computer you will be using.

## Install Etomica
Complete these instructions after your first class and before your second class (11/01-11/03). <br/>
[Mac Users](instructions/install_etomica_MacOS.md) <br/>
[Windows and Linux Users](instructions/install_etomica_Windows.md) <br/>

We will run some simulations using a learning module called etomica developed by Professor David Kofke at the University of Buffalo. Here is a link to the website if you're curious about what it can do http://www.etomica.org/app/modules/

## Install VMD
Complete these instructions after your first class and before your second class (11/01-11/03). <br/>
[Mac Users](instructions/install_VMD_MacOS.md) <br/>
[Windows and Linux Users](instructions/install_VMD_Windows.md) <br/>

VMD is a molecular visualization software. It can be used to visualise simulation data as a video editing software. We're going to use this to visualize some of the complex behavior found in polymers. More information can be found at https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/
